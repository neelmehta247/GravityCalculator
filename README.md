# GravityCalculator
This application displays the value of acceleration due to gravity at your current location.

Gravity is not constant around the world since the world is not perfectly spherical. Acceleration due to gravity can be calculated based on current latitude using an equation found online. This app calculates and displays gravitational acceleration at the current location of the device.
