# GravityCalculator
This application displays the value of acceleration due to gravity at your current location.

Gravity is not constant around the world since the world is not perfectly spherical. So I found an equation online that helped determine the value of acceleration due to gravity. So in this app I found the lattitude of the device and then using that, displayed the value of acceleration due to gravity.
